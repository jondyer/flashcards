# Overview
I am of the opinion (shared by much of the educational cognitive science community) that flashcard-style learning is one of the most effective methods of acquiring and retaining information (see references below). To that end (i.e. acquiring information), as well as satisfying my own organizational needs, this repo contains my flashcard info, sources, and (most importantly) roughly-formatted Latex files containing chunks of code optimized for copy-paste into Anki, a popular free flashcard software (again, see refs).  

TODO: Add references to studies, Anki, etc.  
TODO: Add topics contained in this repo.
